## How to Run the Complete Project

1. **Setup:**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv cord19_env
source cord19_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: cord19_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create directories
mkdir -p data visualizations
Download data from Kaggle and place metadata.csv in data/ folder

Run the complete analysis:

bash

Copy

Download
python main.py
# Choose option 5 to run all parts
Start the Streamlit app:

bash

Copy

Download
streamlit run app.py
This complete implementation meets all the assignment requirements and provides a solid foundation for analyzing the CORD-19 dataset with proper documentation and interactive exploration capabilities.
